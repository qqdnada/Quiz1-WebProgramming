                    Banjarmasin is the best place to absorb Kalimantan’s urban culture, both on land as on the waters. Located on a delta 
                    near the junction of the Barito and Martapura rivers, Banjarmasin, together with its neighboring city, Banjarbaru, form 
                    the center of the ninth largest metropolitan city in Indonesia.
                </p>
                <p class="hometown">
                    From ancient times and up to this day, Banjarmasin has remained an important harbor town on Kalimantan. It has an 
                    abundance of wide and mighty rivers, which have always played a significant role in the Banjarese’ (the indigenous ethnic 
                    group of Banjarmasin) way of life. To this very day, every morning there are floating markets where farmers and merchants 
                    ply their goods on boats to trade. The town’s main attractions are the suburbs that are traversed by canals, where much of 
                    the city's commerce takes place on the water.
                </p>
                <p class="hometown">
                    The most notable of these river markets is the Muara Kuin Floating Market located on the Barito River. The floating 
                    market is the place to see the traffic of all kinds of boats laden with bananas, shrimps, fish, yams, spinach, 
                    coconut, incandescent spices and chilies, buckets of fuzzy rambutans, and whatever other fruit are in season. 
                    Maneuvering their boats with dexterity and precision, since the boats are constantly wobbled by the river’s waves, 
                    traders exchange goods and money.
